# Calculator Project README

## About the Project

A **straightforward** regular calculator able to compute the most fundamental **arithmetic** operations.

---

## Purpose

I am **currently** learning different technologies, but one of them is React.js. This project is a small stepping stone to better my understanding of the component hierarchy, state, props, and data flow in React apps.

---

## Goals

I am not **going to** focus that much on the style of the page, more on learning how to use React as intended.

---

## Usage

To use the calculator:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`).
3. Run the app (`npm start` or `yarn start`).

## Technologies Used
